I spent so much time on this problem. My brain is in ruins. I solved this myself, tried to improve it twice. Tried to bugfix my friends js code. It's enough.

Part 1-2 is normal aoc2022 solutions. part 1 could be solved with part 2 approach of storing folder sizes in a list. but I went with full recursive.

part 3 is without the annoying parent references. I think this is the best way without overcomplicating the process of "cd .."

part 4 was my attempt at solving this without recursive references. There is an annoying bug that I couldn't find the reason, So i'm just giving up.
