Ok this one is a weird one,

I solved part 1 as normal.

During part 2, I accidentally deleted the folder by pressing ctrl + z in vs codes file browser tab. It promted me with "are you sure" window. I was dumbfounded and clicked yes. My folder got deleted. I got frustrated because I wrote a long code and no way I was writing it again. I was content just skipping this day and checking the result on internet. I looked up the solution to see if my solution was close or not. It was very close. I'm sure with time I would be able to find the solution. But then I came up with the ide of checking the trash folder and lo and behold: The folder was there. So in a sense, I cheated but it was unintentional.

I will commit part 1 solution seperately from now on to prevent this lol.
