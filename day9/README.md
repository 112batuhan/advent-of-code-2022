In part 1, I wasn't expecting the manhatten distance between head and tail to be bigger than 3. 
That means I wasn't expecting the head to move in a diagonal so that the tail also has to move diagonal and land diagonally to the head.

But in part 2, tail nodes can do that and land diagonally to other part. To prevent that I calculated manhatten distance and apllied a different set of movement rules. This was my problem and I couldn't figure it out why the result was always wrong despite the results of example input were the same. I only could figure it out after pausing each step and analysing the location of each node.

Well this is similar to snake game and I made my own before so it wasn't that hard.
